                    <p>My Spanished-up version of spaghetti carbonara with spicy chorizo and Amontillado sherry is a
                        winner.Monday night is improv night in my kitchen. After the weekend, the fridge is a trove of
                        bits and pieces, little plates of leftovers, the remains of bunches and punnets. Turning this
                        cabinet of curiosities into dinner is more than just good housekeeping.</p>

                    <h2>Massaman Lamb Shanks</h2>
                    <p>The mellowest of the Thai curries, made slow and tender with lamb shanks.Lamb shanks can be
                        hearty fare, and are desirably so in the depths of winter. Here, however, theyâ€™re lighter and a
                        bit more sprightly. The braising liquid is paler than you might be used to, being made of white
                        wine and chicken stock, and shallower, too, as steam-roasting does a lot of the work.</P>

                    <h2>Leek and Brie Risotto</h2>
                    <p>A rich and comforting take on an Italian classic with gentle leeks and creamy brie.Brodo is broth
                        or stock (although it can be many other liquids, such as coconut milk or the water from soaking
                        dried mushrooms), added slowly and stirred until absorbed.
